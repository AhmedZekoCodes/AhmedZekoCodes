# üí´ About Me:
I am actively working on building websites as a freelancing full-stack developer while pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, which has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.<br><br>I‚Äôm eager to collaborate on big projects with the potential to break the market, as I‚Äôm a big goal setter who thrives on working hard towards ambitious goals.<br><br>If you have a groundbreaking idea or a challenging project, I‚Äôd love to connect and see how we can bring it to life together.<br><br>Right now, I‚Äôm looking for opportunities to gain more internships. My aim is to further hone my skills so that by the time I graduate, I‚Äôll have mastered the craft of full-stack development. I‚Äôm currently learning React, which I‚Äôm focusing on to enhance my front-end development expertise.<br><br>Feel free to ask me about my journey, my projects, or anything tech-related!<br><br>Fun Fact: My love for gaming and computers began at the age of 11, when I started playing around with computer hardware, and that passion has driven me to pursue a career in tech ever since.
